# 🖥️ 8-Bit Computer (Inspired by Ben Eater)

Welcome to my 8-bit computer project! This is a fully functional 8-bit computer built from scratch using **breadboards**, **ICs**, **jumper wires**, and **basic logic gate circuits**, heavily inspired by [Ben Eater's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) legendary series.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a hands-on implementation of a simple 8-bit computer using TTL logic chips. It’s built entirely on breadboards without any microcontrollers or high-level programming – just raw logic and wires. This computer can perform basic arithmetic operations, move data between registers, and execute simple instructions.

## 🧠 Features

- 8-bit bus and architecture  
- Program counter (PC)  
- RAM module (16 bytes)  
- Instruction register (IR)  
- Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)  
- General-purpose registers (A and B)  
- Clock circuit with manual/auto toggle  
- Output display using LEDs  
- Control logic using EEPROMs (or manual ROM)

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Used

- Breadboards  
- 7400-series ICs (e.g., 74LS00, 74LS04, 74LS245, 74LS173, 74LS161, etc.)  
- LEDs  
- Crystal Oscillator or 555 Timer-based Clock  
- Jumper wires  
- Push buttons and switches  
- 7-segment displays (optional)  
- Power supply (5V regulated)

| Registers        | Store intermediate values (A and B)        |
| ALU              | Performs addition and subtraction          |
| Instruction Set  | Custom instructions loaded into EEPROM     |
| Control Logic    | Decodes instructions to control signals    |
| Output Register  | Displays result to LEDs                    |

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Power the computer with a 5V regulated power supply.
2. Manually program the RAM with instructions using switches (or EEPROM if preloaded).
3. Use the clock switch to step through instructions manually or run automatically.
4. Watch as data moves through the registers and output LEDs light up accordingly.

## 📖 Inspiration

This project is based on the famous **8-bit breadboard computer** by [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/), whose tutorials made complex computer architecture beautifully accessible. I learned a lot by following his guidance and added some of my own customizations and enhancements.

## 🙋‍♂️ My Contributions

- Built the hardware circuit entirely on breadboards  
- Designed and debugged the wiring and logic gates  
- Tested instruction sets and ran custom programs  
- Understood and implemented each module individually

---

## 📚 Learnings

- Basics of computer architecture  
- Binary logic and timing coordination  
- How CPUs fetch, decode, and execute instructions  
- Hands-on experience with digital electronics

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add jump instructions for branching  
- Add support for more instructions (AND, OR, etc.)  
- Expand RAM or display modules  
- Build a simple assembler for easier program writing
