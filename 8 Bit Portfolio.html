<h2 id="📌-project-description">📌 Project Description</h2>
<p><em>This project involved building an 8-bit computer entirely from scratch using breadboards, integrated circuits (ICs), jumper wires, and basic logic gate circuits. Inspired by Ben Eater’s educational series, the objective was to understand the low-level workings of a computer — including registers, memory, instruction sets, and the clock cycle — by physically assembling each component. The aim was to gain hands-on experience in computer architecture and digital logic design.</em></p>

<h2 id="⚠️-struggleschallenges">⚠️ Struggles/Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenge 1</strong>: Managing timing issues in clock pulse circuits and ensuring proper synchronization between the ALU and control logic.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge 2</strong>: Debugging connections on the breadboard due to loose jumpers and tight spacing which led to frequent signal loss and errors in logic execution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="🧠-mental-stress-blockers">🧠 Mental Stress Blockers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stress Blocker 1</strong>: I broke the project down into smaller milestones (e.g., building the clock, then the registers, etc.) to reduce overwhelm and maintain steady progress.</li>
<li><strong>Stress Blocker 2</strong>: Took regular short breaks, watched other maker videos, and occasionally stepped away to reset and come back with fresh focus.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="🛠️-resources-used">🛠️ Resources Used</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource 1</strong>: Ben Eater’s YouTube series – Used as a step-by-step guide and conceptual resource.</li>
<li><strong>Resource 2</strong>: Datasheets of 74-series ICs – Helped in understanding the pin configuration and internal logic.</li>

<h2 id="💡-inspiration">💡 Inspiration</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inspiration 1</strong>: Ben Eater’s minimalist 8-bit computer build series, which made complex topics like CPU design accessible and hands-on.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration 2</strong>: A desire to truly understand how computers work from the ground up and not just as a programmer.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="🌍-impact-created">🌍 Impact Created</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact 1</strong>: Developed a foundational understanding of computer architecture, beyond textbook theory, by constructing each component physically.</li>
<li><strong>Impact 2</strong>: The project served as a teaching aid to peers interested in low-level computing and inspired curiosity in embedded systems.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="😊-personal-satisfaction">😊 Personal Satisfaction</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Satisfaction 1</strong>: It was extremely satisfying to see a functional 8-bit computer I built with my own hands run a set of instructions and blink LEDs in response.</li>
<li><strong>Satisfaction 2</strong>: This project boosted my confidence in tackling complex hardware-based builds and laid the groundwork for deeper electronics projects.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="📚-lessons-learned">📚 Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson 1</strong>: Building complex systems from basic components teaches patience, problem-solving, and attention to detail.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson 2</strong>: Understanding the “why” behind each circuit connection or component helps retain knowledge far better than memorization.</li>
